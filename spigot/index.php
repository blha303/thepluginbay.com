<h3>You've been linked to this page because you asked about when Spigot will be released for Minecraft 1.5.</h3>
<p>Spigot for 1.5 will not be available until Craftbukkit updates for 1.5. In the meantime, you can enable <br>
        snapshot-protocol (in the latest recommended or dev builds) in your Spigot <br>
        server's bukkit.yml. Doing this will allow 1.5 clients to connect, BUT 1.4.7 <br>
        clients will NOT be able to connect. 1.5 items will not be craftable. If you <br>
        are experiencing crafting issues, try latest dev build. </p>

<h4>Problems with snapshot-protocol</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can't use 1.5-specific blocks, like quartz
<li>Minecarts crash clients
</ul>
